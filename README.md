Gott's Roadside is a restaurant app that allows users to choose from a given menu, or input custom burgers that they would like to eat.

## Description

+ The application provides the user with a pre-selected list of burgers, displayed on the left. There is a button with the option to 'Devour It'. The right side's list displays the burgers that have already been chosen/input and devoured.

+ The 'Create Your Own' area takes in user input (the name of any burger) and allows the user the opportunity to then devour their burger.

+ Once the user's custom burger is submitted, it will be added to the list of burgers on the left - waiting to be devoured.

+ Once user clicks 'Devour it' the custom burger will be added to the right side's devour list; this will eliminate it as an option to be devoured by another user.
